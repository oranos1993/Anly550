#Figure out how the expected (average) weight of the minimum spanning tree grows as a function of n.
#Find an K(n) to express relation between the average weight and n 
#Three Case:
#1.Complete graphs on n vertices, where the weight of each edge is a real number chosen uniformly at random on [0; 1].
#2.Complete graphs on n vertices, where the vertices are points chosen uniformly at random inside the unit square. (That is, the points are (x; y), with x and y each a real number chosen uniformly at random from [0; 1].) The weight of an edge is just the Euclidean distance between its endpoints.
#3.Complete graphs on n vertices, where the vertices are points chosen uniformly at random inside the unit cube (3 dimensions) and hypercube (4 dimensions). As with the unit square case above, the weight of an edge is just the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. 

#Use Python
